ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.\r\n\r\nENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.\r\n\r\nTop-level domains, like ‘.eth’ and ‘.test’, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use. ENS also supports importing in DNS names already owned by the user for use on ENS.\r\n\r\nBecause of the hierarchal nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired. For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.eth', she can create 'pay.alice.eth' and configure it as she wishes.\r\n\r\nENS is deployed on the Ethereum main network and on several test networks. If you use a library such as the ensjs Javascript library, or an end-user application, it will automatically detect the network you are interacting with and use the ENS deployment on that network.","links":{"homepage":["https://ens.domains/","https://app.ens.domains/",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","https://etherscan.io/token/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://discuss.ens.domains/","",""],"chat_url":["https://chat.ens.domains/","",""],"announcement_url":["https://ens.mirror.xyz/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"ensdomains","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19785/large/acatxTm8_400x400.jpg?1635850140","categories":["Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)","Governance"]},{"id":"game","ensName":"gitcoindao.eth","symbol":"gtc","avatar":"ipfs://QmbAcetpNof7LMCAKCZfzKfKS1UDJwhGZgA8mZR7aW1Xzi","followersCount":29715,"name":"Game","description":"GameCoin (GMC) is a digital currency targeted towards the gaming community. GMC tokens go on sale at the end of September through the GameCoin ICO.\r\n\r\nGameCoin aims to increase the revenue of the gaming industry by 3 times – or 300 billion dollars per year. It aims to allow players to earn money from their hobby. And, within a year, the developers claim the capitalization of GameCoin will “exceed and billion dollars and will continue to grow rapidly.”\r\nGameCoin is being proposed as a way to monetize the world of free gaming. The GameCoin whitepaper explains that the majority of gaming revenue comes from 10% of users. Today, developers are struggling to monetize the remaining 90% of users. GameCoin claims to have found a way to do that using blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nBasically, GameCoin’s idea is to allow each game developer to create their own cryptocurrency. This cryptocurrency is used as in-game money. The developers can create this cryptocurrency at virtually no cost to themselves – it’s just a digital token that has value in the game. However, by the time it circulates through gamers, the token will have value because it can be used to pay for in-game items.\r\n\r\nIn more straightforward terms, GameCoin plans to make it easy for developers to create a secure in-game currency. It appears that these cryptocurrencies will operate as forks on the GameCoin blockchain. Each developer will be able to make their own fork – so gamers can easily apply their GWC tokens to any game of their choice (the GameCoin wallet will support all forks).","links":{"homepage":["http://www.game.com","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xB70835D7822eBB9426B56543E391846C107bd32C","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xb70835d7822ebb9426b56543e391846c107bd32c",null,"","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"gamecom666","facebook_username":"Gamecom-2055954348021983","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2258262,"telegram_channel_identifier":"gameico","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/GameLeLe/trade-addr-tx-service"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2046/large/game.png?1547742459","categories":["Entertainment"]},{"id":"aave","ensName":"aave.eth","symbol":"aave","avatar":"ipfs://QmRKgfxSiCU3EmkN52ZaxgKvDyPFUR5DdPvnKxwyLRncKS","followersCount":26610,"name":"Aave","description":"Aave is a decentralized money market protocol where users can lend and borrow cryptocurrency across 20 different assets as collateral.

Unlike Uniswap, its main focus is only to swap between assets that are supposed to have the same value. This is useful in the DeFi ecosystem as there are plenty of wrapped tokens and synthetic tokens that aim to mimic the price of the real underlying asset. \r\n\r\nFor example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage.\r\n\r\nCurve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield. ","links":{"homepage":["https://www.curve.fi/","https://curve.eth.link/",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52","https://polygonscan.com/token/0x172370d5cd63279efa6d502dab29171933a610af","https://arbiscan.io/token/0x11cdb42b0eb46d95f990bedd4695a6e3fa034978","https://ftmscan.com/token/0x1e4f97b9f9f913c46f1632781732927b9019c68b","https://scan.meter.io/address/0x1e4f97b9f9f913c46f1632781732927b9019c68b","https://ftmscan.com/address/0x1e4f97b9f9f913c46f1632781732927b9019c68b","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/9uEHakc","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"curvefinance","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"curvefi","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract","https://github.com/curvefi/curve-vue"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12124/large/Curve.png?1597369484","categories":["Arbitrum Ecosystem","xDAI Ecosystem","Polygon Ecosystem","Exchange-based Tokens","Decentralized Exchange Token (DEX)","Automated Market Maker (AMM)","Yield Farming","Governance","Decentralized Finance (DeFi)"]},{"id":"xdai-stake","ensName":"xdaistake.eth","symbol":"stake","avatar":"ipfs://QmTmwRjTHcHcPd9TLsBCkg6Hkk36kifPHfSXjN6rVhniDQ","followersCount":7188,"name":"STAKE","description":"STAKE is a new ERC20-type (implemented as an ERC677) token designed to secure the on-chain payment layer and provide a mechanism for validators to receive multiple POS incentives.

The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders.\r\n\r\nIt started out as a passion project by Andre Cronje to automate the process of switching capital between lending platforms in search of the best yield offered, as the lending yield is a floating rate rather than fixed rate. Funds are shifted between dYdX, AAVE, and Compound automatically as interest rates change between these protocols. \r\n\r\nThe service offered includes major USD tokens such as DAI, USDT, USDC, and TUSD. For example, if a user deposits DAI into yearn.finance, the user will receive yDAI token in return, which is a yield-bearing DAI token. \r\n\r\nLater on, it collaborated with Curve Finance to release a yield-bearing USD tokens pool that includes four y-tokens: yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD, it is named as yUSD. \r\n\r\nYearn Finance debuted the vault feature after its token launch, igniting a frenzy on automated yield farming and is considered the initiator of the category of yield farming aggregator. Basically, the vault will help users to claim yield farming rewards and sell it for the underlying assets. \r\n\r\nVaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy.

Smart contract is essentially a computer code that runs exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met.\r\n\r\nEthereum allows programmers to run complete-turing smart contracts that is capable of any customizations. Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to have complete control over customization of their smart contract, giving developers the power to build unique and innovative applications.\r\n\r\nEthereum being the first blockchain based smart contract platform, they have gained much popularity, resulting in new competitors fighting for market share.

The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called “stable coins.” Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or “tether” the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] “100% backed by USD” (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can’t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>).\r\n\r\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\r\n\r\nUSDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\">Poloniex</a> or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account.","links":{"homepage":["https://tether.to/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/omni/property/31","https://www.omniexplorer.info/asset/31","https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7","https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t","https://polygonscan.com/token/0xc2132d05d31c914a87c6611c10748aeb04b58e8f","https://bscscan.com/token/0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955","https://blockexplorer.boba.network/","https://cronos-explorer.crypto.org/token/0x66e428c3f67a68878562e79a0234c1f83c208770","https://snowtrace.io/token/0x9702230a8ea53601f5cd2dc00fdbc13d4df4a8c7"],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://www.facebook.com/tether.to","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"Tether_to","facebook_username":"tether.to","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/325/large/Tether-logo.png?1598003707","categories":["Near Protocol Ecosystem","Fantom Ecosystem","Arbitrum Ecosystem",null,"Avalanche Ecosystem","Binance Smart Chain Ecosystem","Polygon Ecosystem","USD Stablecoin","Stablecoins"]},{"id":"head-football","ensName":"theheaddao.eth","symbol":"head","avatar":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-spaces/master/spaces/theheaddao.eth/space.png","followersCount":1235,"name":"Head Football","description":"\"Head Football is a new crypto currency that allows you to enjoy the game and also make money by duelling other opponents.\r\nOur team loves football and crypto, especially it's ability to disrupt barriers and create global communities.\r\nFor that reason, a token that combines both must be called Head Football We hope to build one of the largest communities in crypto, giving seasoned fans and new fans unique and once in a lifetime opportunities through our community prize system!\r\nOur amazing tokenomics will have you amazed for days, we also will have football duellos available for you to play on our app where you can play against the computer or against other members of the community to win amazing cash prizes instantly.\"","links":{"homepage":["https://www.headfootball.io","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/token/0x7917c830eca3360e24e09fd422310a734ac9d2c9","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"headfootball_io","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"headfootball","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HeadFootballOfficial/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/HeadFootball/HeadFootball"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/23160/large/LOGOLOGO.jpg?1643354051","categories":["Binance Smart Chain Ecosystem"]},{"id":"friends-with-benefits-pro","ensName":"friendswithbenefits.eth","symbol":"fwb","avatar":"ipfs://QmVEc3sawA2fuTXA6NEWo1TyQEyYV5CufZTcCvqef23SzU","followersCount":1054,"name":"Friends With Benefits Pro","description":"","links":{"homepage":["https://fwb.help/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x35bd01fc9d6d5d81ca9e055db88dc49aa2c699a8","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x35bd01fc9d6d5d81ca9e055db88dc49aa2c699a8","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/fwb","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"FWBtweets","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14391/large/xRGEXmQN_400x400.png?1615868085","categories":["Social Money"]},{"id":"bancor-governance-token","ensName":"bancornetwork.eth","symbol":"vbnt","avatar":"ipfs://Qmc2iBx13Xtk1Fc8VQhC1FZpnbp83gVpbmGMaftUKUv2Ut","followersCount":1047,"name":"Bancor Governance Token","description":"vBNT is the governance token of Bancor.

The following graphs compare the price curves of DODO (PMM) and Uniswap (AMM).","links":{"homepage":["https://dodoex.io/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x43dfc4159d86f3a37a5a4b3d4580b888ad7d4ddd","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x43dfc4159d86f3a37a5a4b3d4580b888ad7d4ddd","https://bscscan.com/token/0x67ee3cb086f8a16f34bee3ca72fad36f7db929e2","https://arbiscan.io/token/0x69eb4fa4a2fbd498c257c57ea8b7655a2559a581","https://polygonscan.com/token/0xe4bf2864ebec7b7fdf6eeca9bacae7cdfdaffe78","https://explorer.mainnet.aurora.dev/token/0xe301ed8c7630c9678c39e4e45193d1e7dfb914f7/token-transfers","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/tyKReUK","",""],"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/dodoex",""],"twitter_screen_name":"BreederDodo","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"dodoex_official","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DodoEx/","repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12651/large/dodo_logo.png?1601433025","categories":["Decentralized Exchange Token (DEX)","Polygon Ecosystem","Arbitrum Ecosystem","Binance Smart Chain Ecosystem","Decentralized Finance (DeFi)","Exchange-based Tokens"]},{"id":"ethereum","ensName":"optimismio.eth","symbol":"eth","avatar":"ipfs://QmWqgR3cWYRuGq9HggTpG1ZTbzMRJ1vBWyEzGqe2nMbqMK","followersCount":969,"name":"Ethereum","description":"Ethereum is a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=29&view=market\">smart contract platform</a> that enables developers to build tokens and decentralized applications (dapps). ETH is the native currency for the Ethereum platform and also works as the transaction fees to miners on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nEthereum is the pioneer for blockchain based smart contracts. Smart contract is essentially a computer code that runs exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met.\r\n\r\nEthereum allows programmers to run complete-turing smart contracts that is capable of any customizations. Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to have complete control over customization of their smart contract, giving developers the power to build unique and innovative applications.\r\n\r\nEthereum being the first blockchain based smart contract platform, they have gained much popularity, resulting in new competitors fighting for market share.

Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to have complete control over customization of their smart contract, giving developers the power to build unique and innovative applications.\r\n\r\nEthereum being the first blockchain based smart contract platform, they have gained much popularity, resulting in new competitors fighting for market share.

ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.\r\n\r\nENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.\r\n\r\nTop-level domains, like ‘.eth’ and ‘.test’, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use. ENS also supports importing in DNS names already owned by the user for use on ENS.\r\n\r\nBecause of the hierarchal nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired. For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.eth', she can create 'pay.alice.eth' and configure it as she wishes.\r\n\r\nENS is deployed on the Ethereum main network and on several test networks. If you use a library such as the ensjs Javascript library, or an end-user application, it will automatically detect the network you are interacting with and use the ENS deployment on that network.","links":{"homepage":["https://ens.domains/","https://app.ens.domains/",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","https://etherscan.io/token/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://discuss.ens.domains/","",""],"chat_url":["https://chat.ens.domains/","",""],"announcement_url":["https://ens.mirror.xyz/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"ensdomains","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19785/large/acatxTm8_400x400.jpg?1635850140","categories":["Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)","Governance"]},{"id":"ribbon-finance","ensName":"rbn.eth","symbol":"rbn","avatar":"ipfs://QmccDpEjfWSE3ouJreD9NzjpyDrC8kAhDyiDDrRJ3u8Gc6","followersCount":399,"name":"Ribbon Finance","description":"Ribbon Finance is a new protocol that helps users access crypto structured products for DeFi.

The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders.\r\n\r\nIt started out as a passion project by Andre Cronje to automate the process of switching capital between lending platforms in search of the best yield offered, as the lending yield is a floating rate rather than fixed rate. Funds are shifted between dYdX, AAVE, and Compound automatically as interest rates change between these protocols. \r\n\r\nThe service offered includes major USD tokens such as DAI, USDT, USDC, and TUSD. For example, if a user deposits DAI into yearn.finance, the user will receive yDAI token in return, which is a yield-bearing DAI token. \r\n\r\nLater on, it collaborated with Curve Finance to release a yield-bearing USD tokens pool that includes four y-tokens: yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD, it is named as yUSD. \r\n\r\nYearn Finance debuted the vault feature after its token launch, igniting a frenzy on automated yield farming and is considered the initiator of the category of yield farming aggregator. Basically, the vault will help users to claim yield farming rewards and sell it for the underlying assets. \r\n\r\nVaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy. It is akin to a crypto hedge fund where the aim is to increase the amount of assets that users deposited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","links":{"homepage":["https://yearn.finance","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x0bc529c00c6401aef6d220be8c6ea1667f6ad93e","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x0bc529c00c6401aef6d220be8c6ea1667f6ad93e","https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/tokens/0xbf65bfcb5da067446CeE6A706ba3Fe2fB1a9fdFd/token-transfers","https://arbiscan.io/token/0x82e3a8f066a6989666b031d916c43672085b1582","https://polygonscan.com/token/0xda537104d6a5edd53c6fbba9a898708e465260b6","https://snowtrace.io/token/0x9eaac1b23d935365bd7b542fe22ceee2922f52dc","https://ftmscan.com/token/0x29b0da86e484e1c0029b56e817912d778ac0ec69","https://scan.meter.io/address/0x29b0da86e484e1c0029b56e817912d778ac0ec69","https://ftmscan.com/address/0x29b0da86e484e1c0029b56e817912d778ac0ec69",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/93PHbB4","",""],"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/iearn",""],"twitter_screen_name":"iearnfinance","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"yearnfinance","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/yearn_finance/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/iearn-finance/ygov-finance","https://github.com/iearn-finance/itoken","https://github.com/iearn-finance/iearn-finance","https://github.com/iearn-finance/yswap-finance"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11849/large/yfi-192x192.png?1598325330","categories":["Fantom Ecosystem","Arbitrum Ecosystem","Avalanche Ecosystem","Polygon Ecosystem","xDAI Ecosystem","Yearn Ecosystem","Yield Aggregator","Yield Farming","Governance","Decentralized Finance (DeFi)"]},{"id":"gro-dao-token","ensName":"gro.xyz","symbol":"gro","avatar":"ipfs://QmQZrGJu9HA7ZJkoSLksyDs2w9fQXx2S3JnV4StMqZbuQy","followersCount":373,"name":"Gro DAO Token","description":"Gro is a yield optimizer that enables leverage and protection through risk tranching.

Amp supports a wide variety of use cases for collateralization, and also introduces the concept of predefined partition strategies, which can enable special capabilities such as collateral models through which tokens can be staked without ever leaving their original address.","links":{"homepage":["https://amptoken.org","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xff20817765cb7f73d4bde2e66e067e58d11095c2","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xff20817765cb7f73d4bde2e66e067e58d11095c2","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/T4EY6yx","",""],"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/amptoken",""],"twitter_screen_name":"amptoken","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"ampchat","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/amptoken"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12409/large/amp-200x200.png?1599625397","categories":["Decentralized Finance (DeFi)","Governance"]},{"id":"aave","ensName":"lendhub.eth","symbol":"aave","avatar":"ipfs://QmbXxz9cpy8ZzqPVpkSosF7VsuyDD56NwrnZrhbcJCmMKG","followersCount":200,"name":"Aave","description":"Aave is a decentralized money market protocol where users can lend and borrow cryptocurrency across 20 different assets as collateral.

ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.\r\n\r\nENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.\r\n\r\nTop-level domains, like ‘.eth’ and ‘.test’, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use. ENS also supports importing in DNS names already owned by the user for use on ENS.\r\n\r\nBecause of the hierarchal nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired. For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.eth', she can create 'pay.alice.eth' and configure it as she wishes.\r\n\r\nENS is deployed on the Ethereum main network and on several test networks. If you use a library such as the ensjs Javascript library, or an end-user application, it will automatically detect the network you are interacting with and use the ENS deployment on that network.","links":{"homepage":["https://ens.domains/","https://app.ens.domains/",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","https://etherscan.io/token/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://discuss.ens.domains/","",""],"chat_url":["https://chat.ens.domains/","",""],"announcement_url":["https://ens.mirror.xyz/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"ensdomains","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19785/large/acatxTm8_400x400.jpg?1635850140","categories":["Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)","Governance"]},{"id":"mooney","ensName":"tomoondao.eth","symbol":"mooney","avatar":"ipfs://QmdVQopA4bQ5UutJKmVhsYEdXTP5jaweFSYh4f4F5yR9KT","followersCount":185,"name":"Moon DAO","description":"\"MoonDAO's mission is to decentralize access to space.\r\n\r\nMoonDAO represents a decentralized, international, inclusive, and transparent approach to space exploration.

Enigma wants to extend Ethereum Smart Contracts by introducing secret contracts, a brand of smart contract that gives users an element of privacy that’s not intrinsic to current blockchain protocols. These contracts operate off-chain, meaning the execution of the Smart Contract doesn’t occur on the Ethereum blockchain itself. This is how the Enigma protocol works: it breaks up the Smart Contract and any related data into pieces, encrypts those pieces, and distributes them redundantly among Enigma nodes.\r\n\r\nEnigma has a protocol level. The Enigma privacy protocol allows for decentralized computation of sensitive data. It has a platform layer too. On this protocol, dozens of platforms such as data marketplaces and AI exchanges can be built. In its application layer, it enables thousands of truly decentralized apps that require private computation and secure data.Its first application is catalyst. Catalyst is the first application to be built on the Enigma protocol, already active with tens of thousands of users. Catalyst is a revolutionary platform for data-driven cryptoasset investing and research, built for professional crypto traders.\r\n\r\nEnigma has a team of MIT graduates, and they’ve been working diligently to ensure Enigma’s success. Guy Zyskind, Enigma’s CEO and cofounder, helped start the project while he was still a student at MIT. He has more than a decade of software development experience with an M.S. from MIT. Sandy Pentland, a well known MIT data scientist who gained fame for his work in data-mining social interactions, is Zyskind and Nathan’s adviser on Enigma. With other advisors such as Alex Pentland, who sits on the Advisory Boards for Google and Nissan, CEO of Abra, Bill Barhydt and director of MIT media lab, Prof. Alex Pentland, it is hard to difficult a fault in the team.","links":{"homepage":["https://enigma.co/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xf0ee6b27b759c9893ce4f094b49ad28fd15a23e4","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xf0ee6b27b759c9893ce4f094b49ad28fd15a23e4","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/SJK32GY","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"enigmampc","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2052215,"telegram_channel_identifier":"enigmacatalyst","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/EnigmaProject/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/enigmampc/enigma-p2p","https://github.com/enigmampc/enigma-core","https://github.com/enigmampc/enigma-contract"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1007/large/enigma-logo.png?1547034914","categories":["Smart Contract Platform","Privacy Coins"]},{"id":"daostack","ensName":"genesisblocks.eth","symbol":"gen","avatar":"https://genesisblocks.art/assets/img/prereveal.jpg","followersCount":181,"name":"DAOstack","description":"DAOstack is an operational stack for DAOs, a comprehensive toolkit for decentralized collaboration at scale.

With the creation of more open resources, the DAO will be able to scale indefinitely while keeping its agility and coherence,and in many cases out compete existing corporate structures.

ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.\r\n\r\nENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.\r\n\r\nTop-level domains, like ‘.eth’ and ‘.test’, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use.

ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.\r\n\r\nENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.\r\n\r\nTop-level domains, like ‘.eth’ and ‘.test’, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use. ENS also supports importing in DNS names already owned by the user for use on ENS.\r\n\r\nBecause of the hierarchal nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired.

The Aragon project is open source and led by the Aragon Foundation. It also includes a token, ANT, that grants voting rights to make decisions about the direction of future development. Eventually, Aragon hopes to be a fully decentralized autonomous organization and dApp that’s a neutral jurisdiction for anyone to create an organization on the blockchain. \r\n\r\nIn the early days of development, the project is relying on the nonprofit Aragon Foundation to provide direction and support as the project gets off the ground. The idea, however, is to eventually dissolve, scale back, or change the nature of the Foundation as community support grows. In the future, Aragon will be entirely decentralized and community led. Holders of the ANT token will have voting rights on all issues concerning Aragon. Aragon is an open source, non-profit project. It has many contributors. It also doesn’t technically have a CEO or CTO. Instead, it has a project lead. But don’t get it twisted, the lead is essentially the CEO. uis Cuende is leading the project. In 2011, he received a “Best Underage European Programmer” award, and he’s a recipient of Forbes’ 30 under 30 recognition. He’s a young guy, but with leadership and technical chops. He has advised the Vice President of the European Commission and is an MIT Innovators Under 35 awardee. He has founded several startups and created the first Linux distribution with face login.\r\n\r\nAragon offers several core features. It has a module for identity management and closely related modules for ownership and access control. Other modules include shareholder voting, fundraising through token generation, HR onboarding and payroll, and accounts payable/receivable. Taken together, the core functionality of Aragon covers the critical aspects of accounting, governance, and identity that make modern companies work. As you can see, these modules make up most of the administrative functions that a modern company or organization requires. It’s important to emphasize that these modules can individually be turned on and off, providing instant customization for the company’s needs. In addition, all of the code behind Aragon is open source. A company’s development team could edit them as needed to fulfill the company’s requirements. \r\n\r\nThe modular design of Aragon doesn’t stop with the core modules that come standard. Just as companies can edit existing modules, they’re free to develop completely new models as well. They can also develop atop the data and structures of existing models for extended functionality. The modular nature of Aragon, combined with its open source ethos, means we could see a whole ecosystem of free to use modules that extend capacity for organizations on Aragon. Aragon explicitly has the goal of creating a digital jurisdiction. Just like countries have jurisdiction over their citizens when it comes to courts of law, Aragon wants to create the first digital court of law. This court wouldn’t operate based on country boundaries. Instead, it would help enforce digital contracts between organizations on the Aragon platform.\r\n\r\nThe ANT token is the native token of Aragon and plays a critical role in the governance model and incentive structure of the platform. It represents the wealth of the decentralized economy and was initially sold during Aragon’s highly successful ICO in May 2017 that raised $24 million. Subsequently, the ANT token has come to represent a powerful share of the governance on the platform. ANT holders can vote on proposals, participate in arbitration and the decentralized court system, and help contribute to the non-profit Aragon Foundation or to research and development through the Aragon Nest program.","links":{"homepage":["https://aragon.org/","https://aragon.one/",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xa117000000f279d81a1d3cc75430faa017fa5a2e","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xa117000000f279d81a1d3cc75430faa017fa5a2e","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"AragonProject","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1880338,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/aragonproject","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/aragon/aragon-core"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/681/large/JelZ58cv_400x400.png?1601449653","categories":["Cosmos Ecosystem","Software","Governance"]},{"id":"nftx","ensName":"nftx.eth","symbol":"nftx","avatar":"","followersCount":93,"name":"NFTX","description":"NFT-backed index funds on Ethereum","links":{"homepage":["https://nftx.org/#/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/address/0x87d73E916D7057945c9BcD8cdd94e42A6F47f776","https://etherscan.io/token/0x87d73E916D7057945c9BcD8cdd94e42A6F47f776","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x87d73e916d7057945c9bcd8cdd94e42a6f47f776","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/5ygF8rxdYR","",""],"announcement_url":["https://blog.nftx.org/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"nftx_","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/NFTX-project/x-contracts"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13574/large/NFTX_%28Real%29.jpg?1613449530","categories":["Asset Manager","Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)","Decentralized Finance (DeFi)"]},{"id":"kylin-network","ensName":"kyl.eth","symbol":"kyl","avatar":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kylin-Network/kylin-web/master/kylin_logo.png","followersCount":91,"name":"Kylin Network","description":"Kylin Network offers any applications and blockchains (such as parachains and parathreads) instantaneous but reliable and valid on/off-chain market data and social data sources by leveraging the power of Polkadot/Substrate Framework on open networks.","links":{"homepage":["https://kylin.network/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x67B6D479c7bB412C54e03dCA8E1Bc6740ce6b99C","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x67b6d479c7bb412c54e03dca8e1bc6740ce6b99c","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/PwYCssr","",""],"announcement_url":["https://kylinnetwork.medium.com/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"Kylin_Network","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"KylinOfficial","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Kylin-Network"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14164/large/kylin_logo.png?1615771554","categories":["Business Services","Infrastructure","Polkadot Ecosystem","Smart Contract Platform","Oracle"]},{"id":"constitutiondao","ensName":"ens520.eth","symbol":"people","avatar":"ipfs://QmUuX9GK8WRFoGPsTxM2TFpt4G5dA3h4Qp96mYyJKjUNEU","followersCount":91,"name":"ConstitutionDAO","description":"","links":{"homepage":["https://www.constitutiondao.com/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x7a58c0be72be218b41c608b7fe7c5bb630736c71","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x7a58c0be72be218b41c608b7fe7c5bb630736c71","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/p2jdESeVfy","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"constitutiondao","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20612/large/GN_UVm3d_400x400.jpg?1637294355","categories":[]},{"id":"ethereum","ensName":"huangyu.eth","symbol":"eth","avatar":"ipfs://QmcbhEZpkEfCq8muKMhNe4Xu1qbPUNn9gbRzyeKSTwu8PT","followersCount":90,"name":"Ethereum","description":"Ethereum is a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=29&view=market\">smart contract platform</a> that enables developers to build tokens and decentralized applications (dapps). ETH is the native currency for the Ethereum platform and also works as the transaction fees to miners on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nEthereum is the pioneer for blockchain based smart contracts. Smart contract is essentially a computer code that runs exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met.\r\n\r\nEthereum allows programmers to run complete-turing smart contracts that is capable of any customizations. Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to have complete control over customization of their smart contract, giving developers the power to build unique and innovative applications.\r\n\r\nEthereum being the first blockchain based smart contract platform, they have gained much popularity, resulting in new competitors fighting for market share.

ETH is the native currency for the Ethereum platform and also works as the transaction fees to miners on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nEthereum is the pioneer for blockchain based smart contracts. Smart contract is essentially a computer code that runs exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met.\r\n\r\nEthereum allows programmers to run complete-turing smart contracts that is capable of any customizations. Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to have complete control over customization of their smart contract, giving developers the power to build unique and innovative applications.\r\n\r\nEthereum being the first blockchain based smart contract platform, they have gained much popularity, resulting in new competitors fighting for market share.

ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.\r\n\r\nENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.\r\n\r\nTop-level domains, like ‘.eth’ and ‘.test’, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use. ENS also supports importing in DNS names already owned by the user for use on ENS.\r\n\r\nBecause of the hierarchal nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired. For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.eth', she can create 'pay.alice.eth' and configure it as she wishes.\r\n\r\nENS is deployed on the Ethereum main network and on several test networks. If you use a library such as the ensjs Javascript library, or an end-user application, it will automatically detect the network you are interacting with and use the ENS deployment on that network.","links":{"homepage":["https://ens.domains/","https://app.ens.domains/",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","https://etherscan.io/token/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://discuss.ens.domains/","",""],"chat_url":["https://chat.ens.domains/","",""],"announcement_url":["https://ens.mirror.xyz/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"ensdomains","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19785/large/acatxTm8_400x400.jpg?1635850140","categories":["Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)","Governance"]},{"id":"nucypher","ensName":"nudao.eth","symbol":"nu","avatar":"https://www.nucypher.com/coinmark_blue_lg%20256x256.png","followersCount":76,"name":"NuCypher","description":"Privacy layer for distributed systems and decentralized applications.

Each PAL token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g., BUSD, PAL-BUSD LP Tokens etc etc) in the Paladin DAO treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Paladin DAO also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and minting. \r\n\r\nOur goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, native on the BSC network, in which the behavior of the PAL token is controlled at a high level by the DAO. In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that PAL can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.\r\n\r\nWe intend to achieve price flatness for a representative basket of goods without the use of fiat currency, in order to allow the cryptocurrency industry to detach once and for all from the traditional finance world!\r\n\r\nHow do I participate in Paladin DAO?\r\n\r\nThere are two main strategies for market participants: staking and minting. Stakers stake their PAL tokens in return for more PAL tokens, while minters provide LP tokens or BUSD tokens in exchange for discounted PAL tokens after a fixed vesting period.\r\n\r\nHow can I benefit from Paladin DAO?\r\n\r\nThe main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new PAL tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.\r\nThe main benefit for minters comes from price consistency. Minters commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is given in PAL tokens and thus the minter's profit would depend on PAL price when the minted PAL matures. Taking this into consideration, minters benefit from a rising or static price for the PAL token!","links":{"homepage":["https://www.paladindao.com/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/token/0xB4dA413D7643000A84C5B62Bfb1bF2077604b165","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/paladindao","",""],"announcement_url":["https://paladindao.medium.com/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"DaoPaladin","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"paladindaotoken","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22822/large/logo_%283%29.png?1642662751","categories":["Binance Smart Chain Ecosystem"]},{"id":"ethereum","ensName":"neuramon.eth","symbol":"eth","avatar":"","followersCount":74,"name":"Ethereum","description":"Ethereum is a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=29&view=market\">smart contract platform</a> that enables developers to build tokens and decentralized applications (dapps). ETH is the native currency for the Ethereum platform and also works as the transaction fees to miners on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nEthereum is the pioneer for blockchain based smart contracts. Smart contract is essentially a computer code that runs exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met.\r\n\r\nEthereum allows programmers to run complete-turing smart contracts that is capable of any customizations. Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to have complete control over customization of their smart contract, giving developers the power to build unique and innovative applications.\r\n\r\nEthereum being the first blockchain based smart contract platform, they have gained much popularity, resulting in new competitors fighting for market share.

First place wins 50% of the reward pool, second and third place split the second half of the pool. Winnings are paid out in RIOT Tokens.  When entering a race, players are presented with the Race Conditions. With this in mind, players select from several options that makeup their Race Strategy to compete in the race.

ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.\r\n\r\nENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.\r\n\r\nTop-level domains, like ‘.eth’ and ‘.test’, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use. ENS also supports importing in DNS names already owned by the user for use on ENS.\r\n\r\nBecause of the hierarchal nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired. For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.eth', she can create 'pay.alice.eth' and configure it as she wishes.\r\n\r\nENS is deployed on the Ethereum main network and on several test networks. If you use a library such as the ensjs Javascript library, or an end-user application, it will automatically detect the network you are interacting with and use the ENS deployment on that network.","links":{"homepage":["https://ens.domains/","https://app.ens.domains/",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","https://etherscan.io/token/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://discuss.ens.domains/","",""],"chat_url":["https://chat.ens.domains/","",""],"announcement_url":["https://ens.mirror.xyz/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"ensdomains","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19785/large/acatxTm8_400x400.jpg?1635850140","categories":["Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)","Governance"]},{"id":"kleros","ensName":"kleros.eth","symbol":"pnk","avatar":"ipfs://QmexCozugEY4CQESLZ2HDTrPqUXjC18QdaQwx8kJ8w91dv","followersCount":48,"name":"Kleros","description":"Kleros is a blockchain Dispute Resolution Layer that provides fast, secure and affordable arbitration for virtually everything.\r\n\r\nKleros uses blockchain and crowdsourced specialists to adjudicate disputes in a fast, secure and affordable way.

ETH is the native currency for the Ethereum platform and also works as the transaction fees to miners on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nEthereum is the pioneer for blockchain based smart contracts. Smart contract is essentially a computer code that runs exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met.\r\n\r\nEthereum allows programmers to run complete-turing smart contracts that is capable of any customizations. Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to have complete control over customization of their smart contract, giving developers the power to build unique and innovative applications.\r\n\r\nEthereum being the first blockchain based smart contract platform, they have gained much popularity, resulting in new competitors fighting for market share. The competitors includes: <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum_classic\">Ethereum Classic</a> which is the oldchain of Ethereum, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/qtum\">Qtum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eos\">EOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/neo\">Neo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/icon\">Icon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron\">Tron</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano\">Cardano</a>.\r\n\r\nEthereum wallets are fairly simple to set up with multiple popular choices such as myetherwallet, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/complete-beginners-guide-to-metamask?locale=en\">metamask</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/trezor-model-t-wallet-review\">Trezor</a>.

GMC tokens go on sale at the end of September through the GameCoin ICO.\r\n\r\nGameCoin aims to increase the revenue of the gaming industry by 3 times – or 300 billion dollars per year. It aims to allow players to earn money from their hobby. And, within a year, the developers claim the capitalization of GameCoin will “exceed and billion dollars and will continue to grow rapidly.”\r\nGameCoin is being proposed as a way to monetize the world of free gaming. The GameCoin whitepaper explains that the majority of gaming revenue comes from 10% of users. Today, developers are struggling to monetize the remaining 90% of users. GameCoin claims to have found a way to do that using blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nBasically, GameCoin’s idea is to allow each game developer to create their own cryptocurrency. This cryptocurrency is used as in-game money. The developers can create this cryptocurrency at virtually no cost to themselves – it’s just a digital token that has value in the game. However, by the time it circulates through gamers, the token will have value because it can be used to pay for in-game items.\r\n\r\nIn more straightforward terms, GameCoin plans to make it easy for developers to create a secure in-game currency. It appears that these cryptocurrencies will operate as forks on the GameCoin blockchain. Each developer will be able to make their own fork – so gamers can easily apply their GWC tokens to any game of their choice (the GameCoin wallet will support all forks).","links":{"homepage":["http://www.game.com","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xB70835D7822eBB9426B56543E391846C107bd32C","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xb70835d7822ebb9426b56543e391846c107bd32c",null,"","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"gamecom666","facebook_username":"Gamecom-2055954348021983","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2258262,"telegram_channel_identifier":"gameico","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/GameLeLe/trade-addr-tx-service"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2046/large/game.png?1547742459","categories":["Entertainment"]},{"id":"lobis","ensName":"frax-lobis.eth","symbol":"lobi","avatar":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20813/small/0tOZIQ0B_400x400.jpg?1637718276","followersCount":40,"name":"Lobis","description":"Lobis is an protocol specialized to participate in DeFi governance. \r\n\r\nOur community determines a basket of governance tokens e.g. CRV and FXS to back $LOBI.

ETH is the native currency for the Ethereum platform and also works as the transaction fees to miners on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nEthereum is the pioneer for blockchain based smart contracts. Smart contract is essentially a computer code that runs exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met.\r\n\r\nEthereum allows programmers to run complete-turing smart contracts that is capable of any customizations. Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to have complete control over customization of their smart contract, giving developers the power to build unique and innovative applications.\r\n\r\nEthereum being the first blockchain based smart contract platform, they have gained much popularity, resulting in new competitors fighting for market share.

The platform allows practically unlimited external compute resources to be applied in a trusted way to extend the performance, throughput, and scalability of its host blockchain. Research began in 2015 on this verification solution which today connects blockchains to both on-chain and off-chain data while enabling smart contracts to securely perform complex computations in standard, easy-to-use programming languages at significantly reduced gas costs. \r\n\r\nUnlike sharding and other methods for distributing high transaction throughput, Truebit processes complex and large transactions via a consensus mechanism involving a minimal number of redundancies, making it a novel solution for Web 3.0 infrastructure. The bulk of computation occurs with off-chain resources.\r\n \r\nVerifier’s Dilemma - What Makes Truebit Unique?\r\n \r\nRather than relying on external, cryptographic proofs of correctness, Truebit brings scalable computation to blockchains by leveraging game theory principles and financial incentives to increase the on-chain computation power of existing networks and reduce marginal gas costs.\r\n \r\nWhile smart contracts can perform small computations correctly, large computation tasks pose security risks for blockchains due to the Verifier's Dilemma. Truebit counteracts this via a retrofitting oracle that achieves correct computational results. Truebit’s microeconomy ensures trustless verification through a financial incentive layer atop a dispute resolution layer.\r\n \r\nWho is the founder of Truebit (TRU)?\r\n \r\nTruebit was founded by mathematician and computer scientist Jason Teutsch who co-authored the whitepaper with Ethereum’s Solidity creator and team lead, Christian Reitwiessner. Jason holds a PhD in Mathematics, was a two-time US Fulbright Fellow, and co-discovered the Verifier’s Dilemma.\r\n \r\nApplications\r\n\r\nApplications include:\r\nLayer-2 settlements \r\nDeFi settlements and bookkeeping\r\nBatch verification of cryptographic signatures\r\nChecking proof-of-work\r\nPerforming operation(s) with high computational complexity\r\n \r\nAny smart contract can issue a computation task to Truebit in standard languages (C, C++, or Rust) without concern for Ethereum’s gas limit. Truebit’s WebAssembly-based architecture can read functions and data from Ethereum bytes, smart contract program code, or IPFS.\r\n \r\nWhat kind of token is Truebit (TRU)?\r\n \r\nThe supply of TRU tokens may fluctuate over time.  \r\n \r\nLearn more about Truebit:\r\n \r\nGetting started with Truebit on Ethereum  \r\nhttps://medium.com/truebit/getting-started-with-truebit-on-ethereum-ac1c7cdb0907\r\nAn Intro to TrueBit: A Scalable, Decentralized Computational Court   https://medium.com/@simondlr/an-intro-to-truebit-a-scalable-decentralized-computational-court-1475531400c3\r\n \r\nLearn more about Ethereum:\r\nEthereum\r\nhttps://ethereum.org/en/","links":{"homepage":["https://truebit.io/#home","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xf65B5C5104c4faFD4b709d9D60a185eAE063276c","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xf65b5c5104c4fafd4b709d9d60a185eae063276c","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/truebit",""],"twitter_screen_name":"Truebitprotocol","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"truebitprotocol1","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/truebit/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/TruebitProtocol/"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/15053/large/Truebit.png?1623296246","categories":[]}]
